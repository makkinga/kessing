In general, I follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Commit changes to your own branch
4. Push your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a Pull request so that I can review your changes

> NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

> TIP: For "small" changes, prefix the repo URL with `vscode.dev/`
